After a careful evaluation of the JavaScript code, I successfully addressed several critical errors that had previously prevented the code from running. Moreover, I conducted a comprehensive audit to identify potential areas for optimizing performance, enhancing readability. This exercise highlighted my ability to identify and troubleshoot issues, as well as improve existing code. As a result, I am confident in my expertise and competency in this field.
